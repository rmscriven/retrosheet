are in the "TeamID" column.}

\item{schedSplit}{One of "Date", "HmTeam", or "TimeOfDay" to return a list
split by the given value, or NULL (the default) for no splitting.}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{logical. The \code{stringsAsFactors} argument as

The following return values are possible for the given \code{type}
\itemize{
\item \code{game} - a data frame of gamelog data for the given year
\item \code{play} - a list, each element of which is a single game's play-by-play

the play-by-play data split into individual matrices.
\item \code{roster} - a named list, each element containing the roster
for the named team for the given year, as a data frame.
