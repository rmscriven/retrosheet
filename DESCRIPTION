Description: A collection of tools to import and structure the (currently) single-season
    event, game-log, roster, and schedule data available from http://www.retrosheet.org.
    In particular, the event (a.k.a. play-by-play) files can be especially difficult to parse.
    This package does the parsing on those files, returning the requested data in the most
    practical R structure to use for sabermetric or other analyses.
